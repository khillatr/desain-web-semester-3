   <h2>PTIK FKIP UNS</h2>
   <p id="teks">
    The <span class="target">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta 
    is an <span class="target">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study 
    programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing 
    <span class="target">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</span>
    <br><br>
    The <span class="target">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is
    planned to take shelter in the management of the <span class="target">Engineering and Vocational
    Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where
    the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program 
    that will produce graduates who are <span class="target">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational 
    programs.</span> So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which 
    oversees vocational programs such as <span class="target">Building Engineering Education</span>, and 
    <span class="target">Mechanical Engineering Education.</span> To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of 
    information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <span class="target">resource sharing with the mathematics study program.</span>
